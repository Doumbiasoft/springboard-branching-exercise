# Branching Exercise

## Part I

Answer the following questions:

- What git command creates a branch?

- `git branch brancheName`
- `git checkout -b branchName`

- What is the difference between a fast-forward and recursive merge?

`fast-forward it is the simple way to make merge without any conflict in the other hand recursive happened when you try to make a merge with two branches with same file with different content.`

- What git command changes to another branch?

- `git checkout branchName`

- What git command deletes a branch?

- `git branch -d branchName` 
- `git branch -D branchName` force delete

- How do merge conflicts happen?


## Part II

Practice with fast forward and recursive merges! Make a branch and add and commit onto it and merge it back into master.
Try to create your own merge conflict by modifying the same file on two separate commits on two separate branches.
